        <h1>"HUMAN ZOO"</h1>
        
        <p>"Human zoos, also known as ethnological expositions, were public displays of people, usually in a so-called "natural" or "primitive" state.[4] They were most prominent during the 19th and 20th centuries.[4] These displays sometimes emphasized the supposed inferiority of the exhibits' culture, and implied the superiority of "Western society", through tropes that purported marginalized groups as "savage".[5][6] The idea of a "savage" derives from Columbus's voyages that deemed European culture remained pure, while other cultures were titled impure or "wild", and this stereotype relies heavily on the idea that different ways of living were "cast out by God", as other cultures do not recognize Christianity in relation to Creation.[6] Throughout their existence such exhibitions garnered controversy over their demeaning, derogatory, and dehumanizing nature.[7] They began as a part of circuses and "freak shows" which displayed exotic humans in a manner akin to a caricature which exaggerated their differences.[4] They then developed into independent displays emphasizing the exhibits' inferiority to western culture and providing further justification for their subjugation.[8] Such displays featured in multiple world's fairs and at temporary exhibitions in animal zoos."</p>
